## About Task:
  Task is a forecasting cast which means we need to fing future prediction of a stock, with the help of recurrent neural network (LSTM) find the future prediction.
  

## Approach:
1. Collected data
2. Analyzed data with the help of classic data analysis technique in Python that is **Exploratory Data Analysis**.
3. Plotted graphs of some important factors such as **Open Price**, **Volume**, **Close Price**.
4. Created a new column **Daily Return** which is daily return of the stock.
5. Analyzed the stock on the basis of **MOVING AVERAGES**.
6. Plotted graphs of stock factors against moving averages.
7. Created new column called Exponentially Weighted Moving Average.
8. By two techniques which are **Simple Exponential Smoothing** and **Exponential Smoothing Method** created a further analysis forcasting,
9. Scaled the data before performing LSTM.
10. Build an LSTM model.
11. Plotted **Predicted vs Actual** and **Stock Price Forcasting graph.**

## Results:

**Open Price vs Predicted Price**
